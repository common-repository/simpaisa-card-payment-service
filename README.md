This is an upgrade of Simpaisa Credit/Debit Card Payment Service version 1.1.5

== Description ==

Simpaisa plug-in for card is a swift way to collect payments from customers on WordPress sites.
Your customers can easily make payments using their debit and credit cards via 3D secure mechanism.
